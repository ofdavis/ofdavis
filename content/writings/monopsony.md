##### Summary:

This article introduces the theory of monopsony to a broader audience, tracing the history of the concept in economic thought and showing why a new crop of findings has helped cement its place in the field of labor economics. It argues that while the theory of monopsony has a long history, what’s novel in recent research is the use of big data to measure it at a national scale.
