##### Summary:

At the same time that scholars and activists have theorized a process of financialization---by which financial motive and interests have expanded in scope and power across society---a growing number of social movements have adopted financial means for their egalitarian ends. This article explores the motivations and meaning behind shareholder activists and union pension funds seeking social change through the stock market and the inherent limitations to such an approach.
