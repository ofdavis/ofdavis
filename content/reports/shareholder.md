##### Summary:

From the utopian socialists of the early 1800s to civil rights activists of the twentieth century and beyond, social reformers have long expressed interest in using financial technologies and institutions for egalitarian ends. This report analyzes the history of these movements and outlines three current-day sources of real or potential socially minded influence in publicly traded stock markets: ethical shareholder activists, pension funds, and sovereign wealth funds.
